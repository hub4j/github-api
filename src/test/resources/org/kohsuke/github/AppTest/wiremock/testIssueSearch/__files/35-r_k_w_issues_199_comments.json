Since it is a trademark-related question, I need @kohsuke's approval to change this field in the **.NET2** package. His decision was to keep the current field value.\r\n\r\n**.NET4** package has been created by me, so I could change the `AssemblyCompany` in this package to something neutral like \"WinSW contributors\". But it still does not really address the use-case when projects/vendors want to have their name in assembly info.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose WinSW can be repackaged or modified with tools like [mt.exe](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa375649(v=vs.85).aspx).\r\n"
