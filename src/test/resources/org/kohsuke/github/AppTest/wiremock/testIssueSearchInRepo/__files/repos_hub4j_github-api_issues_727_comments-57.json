    "body": "@bitwiseman first of all, it was really nice of you to revert the commit. I commend you for doing that. \r\n\r\nMy 2 cents on whether keep or not the ```@author``` on the source code is ... We should keep them because:\r\n\r\n1.  From the performance/software quality point of view, it doesn't impact the way it works.\r\n2.  Keeping them can be interpreted (by some people) as a way of the open-source community express their gratitude for the time and effort that the author put into crafting that piece of code. \r\n3.  This is a common practice on lots of projects too: For instance, [OpenJDK](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/6bab0f539fba8fb441697846347597b4a0ade428/src/java.base/share/classes/java/lang/Override.java#L45), [Spring boot](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/master/spring-boot-project/spring-boot/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/Banner.java#L26), [Linux Kernel](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.5.7/source/kernel/sched/fair.c#L5)\r\n4.  This is a personal one but I confess that I got to know several incredibly brilliant people by reading the ```@author```. For instance:\r\n       1. by reading some of the java classes I learnt about Joshua Bloch, which eventually led me to his legendary book 'Effective Java'. \r\n       2. by doing a similar thing, I learnt about Ingo Molnar and his astonishing work on the [CFS](https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/13/180).\r\n       3. The same goes to this library, I was looking into some of Kohsuke's work while he was working at Sun that eventually led me to this project.  And this led me to become a contributor and also to learn about @bitwiseman and his great work in a project that wasn't being proactively looked after. \r\n\r\nI'm aware of things like:\r\n\r\n- If you want to know who committed a piece of code, just traverse through the git tree and you will find out who committed.\r\n- It's hard to keep them up-to-date.\r\n- We could use the `<contributor>` XML elements on the pom.xml for that purpose.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts on them are that either they don't cover all edge cases or they make the discovery part (knowing who did what/when) a bit harder. That's why we should have multiple discoverable ways available to make things easier rather than harder and since this isn't impacting the library performance-wise then let's keep it :)\r\n\r\nSo all in all, this should be a matter of choice... if the person who committed a piece of code feels comfortable not adding a ```@author``` tag then he/she can do so. The same should work the other way around.  \r\n",

For this I feel that showing gratitude and giving recognition through a dedicated contributor page/list, [like so](https://github.com/dropwizard/metrics/blob/4.1-development/docs/source/about/contributors.rst), actually puts it more front and center than having `@author` tags.\r\n\r\nWhile I wouldn't add `@author` for stuff I contribute nor would I advocate their use in any project I don't care if they're there or not.",
