In other cases it appears the cache obey the `max-age=60` returned by GitHub and thus doesn't even look for new data from some requests.   \r\n\r\nThe cache behavior is fine for client-side uses such as Android where optimizing for network usage is important.  Users of this library are are generally less concerned with network usage - they turn on caching to avoid using up their itHub rate-limit budget.\r\n\r\nThis change modifies the default OkHttpConnect behavior to make OkHttp always check the cache against the GitHub site.  OkHttp still sends the response `ETag` in the request which lets GitHub return a [`304 Not Modified`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/304) if nothing has changed and does not count that request against the users rate-limit. OkHttp handles this response automatically and returns the cached data.  \r\n\r\nThis means that by using a bit more network bandwidth, this change guarantees up-to-date data while keeping the same rate-limit savings. \r\n\r\nThis change has no effect outside the scenario where OkHttpConnector is used with caching.\r\n\r\nThis is basically the same behavior added to Jenkins [here](https://github.com/jenkinsci/github-branch-source-plugin/blob/e7ac121084bcdf1b5959668cea3fb3a22f380686/src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/github_branch_source/Connector.java#L726-L748)."

If the namespace is omitted, the call _ignores_ the `head` parameter entirely, returning all pull requests that match on the other criteria.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, this seems like an oversight in the API and creates quite a pitfall.\r\n\r\nFor example, creating a pull request between two branches in the same repository looks like:\r\n`repository.createPullRequest(\"title\", \"my-branch\", \"master\", null);`\r\nBut the query to pull back the newly created pull request must look like:\r\n`repository.queryPullRequests().state(GHIssueState.OPEN).head(\"my-org:my-branch\").base(\"master\").list();`\r\nForgetting the `my-org:` results in all open pull-requests into the master branch being returned, which is clearly not what was intended in the query.\r\n\r\nThis change causes the `head` value to be namespaced by default if a non-namespaced value is provided, given that providing a non-namespaced value is effectively the same as `null` and will never behave as the developer intended."
