The type should be ```Long``` rather than ```Integer```. Considering that you haven't released it yet, I thought that now was the perfect opportunity to fix it. \r\n\r\n   In case you want me to deprecate the original method and create a second one with the right method signature instead of replacing it, let me now ... it's up to you tbh. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Future work:**\r\nI plan to create another documentation page with the steps related to deal with Github apps but I decided to first focus on the several ways people can authenticate to Github with this library before anything else (most recurrent question IMHO). Also, I needed to know if I am heading in the right direction that you guys have in mind."
