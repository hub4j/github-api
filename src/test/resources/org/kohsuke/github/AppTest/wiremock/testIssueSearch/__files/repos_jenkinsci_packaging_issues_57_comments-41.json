    "body": "@evandandrea Thank you for submitting this, it is a very interesting addition. AFAIK currently our infrastructure will not support a Ubuntu 16.04 build natively, however there is an option to do this via docker containers where supported (we've got an image that can be used for that currently, but it is 14.04 based). \n\nCC @kohsuke and @jtnord for thoughts on adding another packaging format for Jenkins as proposed in this PR?  \n\nMy thought currently is that currently the snap format is very new and niche, so it's probably not worth the major effort to add infra support for it, test the support, and maintain it as a primary distribution in the main project.    However if someone wanted to maintain & distribute a port to snap packaging (similar to how the BSD distributions are done), that would make sense to add to the download links on Jenkins.io once it is mature.   But I'm curious what you all think...\n\nAttaching a reference for the [snapcraft yaml format](https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/snappy/build-apps/snapcraft-syntax/).  From what I can tell this does not support many of the config options currently enabled for the other linux packages, as well as additional service integration, so it would need some work to get to the same state (and significant testing).  \n\n**References for what a snapcraft package would need to be considered an equivalent distribution option:**\n- Init scripts for Debian (showing options): https://github.com/jenkinsci/packaging/blob/master/deb/build/debian/jenkins.init\n- Jenkins config args for Debian (another packaging should more or less support these options): https://github.com/jenkinsci/packaging/blob/master/deb/build/debian/jenkins.default\n- Needs to  work correctly with the common plugins and options (require some significant testing)\n"
