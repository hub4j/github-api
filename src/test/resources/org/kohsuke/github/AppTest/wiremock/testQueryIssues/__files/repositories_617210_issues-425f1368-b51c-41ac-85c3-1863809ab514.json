    "body": "In the Jenkins project we've seen a number of less than ideal behaviors by the OKHttp cache.  \r\nSome instances it seems bad data gets in and then gets stuck in the cache. In other cases it appears the cache obey the `max-age=60` returned by GitHub and thus doesn't even look for new data from some requests.   \r\n\r\nThe cache behavior is fine for client-side uses such as Android where optimizing for network usage is important.  Users of this library are are generally less concerned with network usage - they turn on caching to avoid using up their itHub rate-limit budget.\r\n\r\nThis change modifies the default OkHttpConnect behavior to make OkHttp always check the cache against the GitHub site.  OkHttp still sends the response `ETag` in the request which lets GitHub return a [`304 Not Modified`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/304) if nothing has changed and does not count that request against the users rate-limit. OkHttp handles this response automatically and returns the cached data.  \r\n\r\nThis means that by using a bit more network bandwidth, this change guarantees up-to-date data while keeping the same rate-limit savings. \r\n\r\nThis change has no effect outside the scenario where OkHttpConnector is used with caching.\r\n\r\nThis is basically the same behavior added to Jenkins [here](https://github.com/jenkinsci/github-branch-source-plugin/blob/e7ac121084bcdf1b5959668cea3fb3a22f380686/src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/github_branch_source/Connector.java#L726-L748).",

    "body": "The [create a pull request API](https://developer.github.com/v3/pulls/#create-a-pull-request) does not require a namespace on the head branch when creating a pull request between two branches in the same repository.\r\n\r\nHowever, the [list pull requests API](https://developer.github.com/v3/pulls/#list-pull-requests) **does** require a namespace on the `head` value in order to work properly. If the namespace is omitted, the call _ignores_ the `head` parameter entirely, returning all pull requests that match on the other criteria.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, this seems like an oversight in the API and creates quite a pitfall.\r\n\r\nFor example, creating a pull request between two branches in the same repository looks like:\r\n`repository.createPullRequest(\"title\", \"my-branch\", \"master\", null);`\r\nBut the query to pull back the newly created pull request must look like:\r\n`repository.queryPullRequests().state(GHIssueState.OPEN).head(\"my-org:my-branch\").base(\"master\").list();`\r\nForgetting the `my-org:` results in all open pull-requests into the master branch being returned, which is clearly not what was intended in the query.\r\n\r\nThis change causes the `head` value to be namespaced by default if a non-namespaced value is provided, given that providing a non-namespaced value is effectively the same as `null` and will never behave as the developer intended.",

    "body": "The github api returns a list of assets from the releases endpoint (see https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#list-releases-for-a-repository). This data is ignored when the api data is deserialized due to `GHRelease` not containing an `assets` field. This leads to requiring making additional api calls, one for every release in order to obtain asset information.\r\n\r\nA quick test of adding `List<GHAsset> assets;` to `GHRelease` worked and the api data was correctly parsed into the assets field. I am happy to pull request this change, however this would change the current behaviour to some extent, at the moment every time `GHRelease.getAssets` is called a fresh list of assets is requested from the api. If we were to add `List<GHAsset> assets;` to `GHRelease` this would mean that a set of assets would be cached when the `GHRelease` is created and would remain unchanged even if upstream is updated. The correct behaviour for `GHRelease.uploadAsset` would also need to be determined.\r\n\r\nWould this be viewed as acceptable behaviour?\r\n\r\nThis is quite a significant issue as it produces an unnecessary api call to request data that has already been provided, potentially hitting rate limits.\r\n",

    "body": "This PR implements the GitHub Apps API workflow. Things to be noted:\r\n\r\n- I assumed that JWT is encoded externally and its JWT token is passed as a parameter to be used as an authentication mechanism (like it's done with the OAuth token currently). Implementing JWT encoding logic seemed too cumbersome for the project's value proposition (IMHO)\r\n\r\n- Methods that can only be requested via JWT as part of the Github App workflow are documented\r\n\r\n- On the ```Requester``` class, I had to make the ```with(String key, Collection<String> value)``` more generic as just adding another method like ```with(String key, Collection<Integer> value)``` wouldn't do the trick...and adding a specific method for this seemed weird...but let me know if you want to have this implemented in another way or if you're fine with the approach taken.\r\n\r\nIf you find that this contribution is a good addition to the project, please accept this PR.\r\n\r\nBest regards,",
