    "body": "I only really use the plugin in conjunction with the android-emulator-plugin so do not have much experience with the use of port names.\n\nThat said the existing version converts any name into an upper case name that gets stored in the job config.xml file.\n\nIMHO the import thing is that any existing configurations should not be broken by the change. My initial look at the code suggests that this is the case. Any existing variables will be set as upper case only and any conflicting port checks would be done using the upper case variable names.\n\nWith the change in place lower/mixed case variables would then be treated as being from separate pools and this is where any breakage would potentially occur.\n\nI can see that this may be a problem for new/changed job configurations using existing variables - but any existing variables would be currently listed as being upper case so it would only be people who are used to setting up lots of port setups and not looking at/using the variables. I think it reasonable that we mitigate this by documenting the change in the release notes/popup help text.\n\nThe only cases that I don't have a feel for are where automatic configuration generators may be in use and also any programmatic uses of the allocator from other plugins using the names (android emulator just uses port ranges so is not affected).\n"
