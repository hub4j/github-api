I'm unclear about what the behavior it is you'd like to see.   What would you like to be able to do after `./scripts/hubcli list-pull-requests` above?  Could you describe the steps you'd like to perform in a little more detail (not in terms of the build process for an different project? \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n",
