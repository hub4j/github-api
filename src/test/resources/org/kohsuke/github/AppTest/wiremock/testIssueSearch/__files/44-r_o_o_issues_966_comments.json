    "body": "Not sure what \"actual symbol usage\" means here.  If you mean \"symbols in the surrounding lexical scope\", then, no, OpenGrok doesn't do that.\n\nI usually use the combination of symbol and path fields to approximate this.  That is, using the path field to limit the search to a few files.\n\nThere's also a symbol highlighting functionality that might be helpful to you: when you are on a page that displays actual source code (not search results), hover your mouse pointer on a symbol you're interested in, then press \"2\".  It'll highlight that symbol for you so you can easily spot them in the vicinity.  Press \"2\" again turns it off.  Try \"1\" as well.  It gives you more control.\n"

    "body": "same here, I just limit it with path field, there is a bug open for a long time to make opengrok more smarter (caller-callee) \nfor java this could be done for the cost of slower indexation, though I don't have a clue how to do it for c/c++/etc. so right now this is not done\nI know @kohsuke had a java project, that could do java analysis which we could leverage (I would need to check the license) and it would need some merge work to make a prototype\nbut for other languages I am clueless\n"
