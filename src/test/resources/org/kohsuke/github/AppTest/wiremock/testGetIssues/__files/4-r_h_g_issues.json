    "body": "In the Jenkins project we've seen a number of less than ideal behaviors by the OKHttp cache.  \r\nSome instances it seems bad data gets in and then gets stuck in the cache. In other cases it appears the cache obey the `max-age=60` returned by GitHub and thus doesn't even look for new data from some requests.   \r\n\r\nThe cache behavior is fine for client-side uses such as Android where optimizing for network usage is important.  Users of this library are are generally less concerned with network usage - they turn on caching to avoid using up their itHub rate-limit budget.\r\n\r\nThis change modifies the default OkHttpConnect behavior to make OkHttp always check the cache against the GitHub site.  OkHttp still sends the response `ETag` in the request which lets GitHub return a [`304 Not Modified`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/304) if nothing has changed and does not count that request against the users rate-limit. OkHttp handles this response automatically and returns the cached data.  \r\n\r\nThis means that by using a bit more network bandwidth, this change guarantees up-to-date data while keeping the same rate-limit savings. \r\n\r\nThis change has no effect outside the scenario where OkHttpConnector is used with caching.\r\n\r\nThis is basically the same behavior added to Jenkins [here](https://github.com/jenkinsci/github-branch-source-plugin/blob/e7ac121084bcdf1b5959668cea3fb3a22f380686/src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/github_branch_source/Connector.java#L726-L748)."

If the namespace is omitted, the call _ignores_ the `head` parameter entirely, returning all pull requests that match on the other criteria.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, this seems like an oversight in the API and creates quite a pitfall.\r\n\r\nFor example, creating a pull request between two branches in the same repository looks like:\r\n`repository.createPullRequest(\"title\", \"my-branch\", \"main\", null);`\r\nBut the query to pull back the newly created pull request must look like:\r\n`repository.queryPullRequests().state(GHIssueState.OPEN).head(\"my-org:my-branch\").base(\"main\").list();`\r\nForgetting the `my-org:` results in all open pull-requests into the main branch being returned, which is clearly not what was intended in the query.\r\n\r\nThis change causes the `head` value to be namespaced by default if a non-namespaced value is provided, given that providing a non-namespaced value is effectively the same as `null` and will never behave as the developer intended."
