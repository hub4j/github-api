You need to provide a <<<DeviceFlowGithubAppCredentialListener>>> that will be called when a new user access token is retrieved (either on initial creation or on refresh).\r\n  It is up to you to store the credential object securely the library does not take care of that.\r\n  2. You need to provide a <<<DeviceFlowGithubAppInputManager>>> that will be called when a user interaction is needed to complete the device flow.\r\n  The library provides a basic implementation <<<LoggerDeviceFlowGithubAppInputManager>>> that will log the instructions to the console but you could imagine a more complex\r\n  implementation that would for example open the user browser automatically (or call some automation that will input the information automatically for instance).\r\n\r\n  Here is a complete example to get started:\r\n\r\n+-----+\r\n        var clientId = \"<clientId>\";\r\n        var objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();\r\n        objectMapper.registerModule(new JavaTimeModule());\r\n\r\n        // for demo purpose only, this is not proper secret management!!!\r\n        var appCredentialsFile = Path.of(\"/tmp/github-app-credentials.json\");\r\n        DeviceFlowGithubAppCredentials appCredentials;\r\n        if (Files.exists(appCredentialsFile)) {\r\n            appCredentials = objectMapper.readValue(appCredentialsFile.toFile(), DeviceFlowGithubAppCredentials.class);\r\n        } else {\r\n            appCredentials = EMPTY_CREDENTIALS;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        var gh = new GitHubBuilder().withAuthorizationProvider(\r\n                new DeviceFlowGithubAppAuthorizationProvider(clientId, appCredentials, ac -> {\r\n                  // in this basic example, we serialize the credentials as json to a file\r\n                  // this is not proper secret management and you should probably use something more secure\r\n                    try {\r\n                        objectMapper.writeValue(appCredentialsFile.toFile(), ac);\r\n                    } catch (IOException e) {\r\n                        throw new RuntimeException(e);\r\n                    }\r\n                }, new LoggerDeviceFlowGithubAppInputManager())).build();\r\n+-----+\r\n``` \r\n\r\nOpened questions I have:\r\n\r\n* I'm not too happy that the main class (`DeviceFlowGithubAppAuthorizationProvider`) cannot be in the authorization package (needs access to a package protected method).\r\n* I'm not too sure how to process with tests: I cannot use the recording method since the authorization process is not going through the api endpoints but through the UI ones (`https://github.com/...`). I didn't find anything in the base class test that would help with this. Also I have to use the `.setRawUrlPath(\"https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token\")` which cannot be intercepted as is obviously. This is not only a problem for tests but also for on prem Github and my current thinking is that I need to enrich the API and the testing framework to support a `uiUrl` that would be the equivalent of the `apiUrl` for the UI.\r\n\r\nSince this starts to widen the impact of this change I'm opening this draft to discuss the potential approaches before going further.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your change here -->\r\n\r\n# Before submitting a PR:\r\n\r\n- [x] Changes must not break binary backwards compatibility.

The `account` polymorphic deserialization part works fine though.

You will create your PR from that branch.\r\n\r\n# When creating a PR: \r\n\r\n- [x] Fill in the \"Description\" above with clear summary of the changes. This includes:\r\n  - [x] If this PR fixes one or more issues, include \"Fixes #<issue number>\" lines for each issue. \r\n  - [x] Provide links to relevant documentation on https://docs.github.com/en/rest where possible. If not including links, explain why not.\r\n- [x] All lines of new code should be covered by tests as reported by code coverage. Any lines that are not covered must have PR comments explaining why they cannot be covered.
