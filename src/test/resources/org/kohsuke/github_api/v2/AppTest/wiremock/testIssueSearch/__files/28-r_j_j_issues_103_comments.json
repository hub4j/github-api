    "body": "kohsuke said:\nThis is actually the expected behavior.\n\nIn 1.0, we did what ramazanyich2 wanted us to do — namely, declare namespaces\nlazily on-demand, only when it's necessary. Often this results in namespaces\ndeclared multiple places in sub-trees, and many people weren't happy with this.\n\nWe can't make it any smarter, as in short of traversing the whole object tree,\nThe marshaller won't be able to discover all the namespaces in use. Such\ntraversal would be very costly.\n\nSo in 2.0 we decided to change the behavior to always declare all the statically\nknown namespaces upfront. This also made the namespace management inside the\nmarshaller simpler, contributed to the overall performance improvement.\n\nGiven those background, at this point we are not planning to change this behavior."

    "body": "mindchi said:\nI'm requesting that this issue be reopened as having the extraneous namespaces\ncauses problems when using JAXB as the data binding framework for CXF. Firstly,\nI think it is unacceptable to have a solution which changes your data. If I\ntake an XML file read it in and write it back out, I should end up with exactly\nthe same file. Not a file that has extra stuff in it. This reason alone should\nbe enough to warrant a fix.\n\nI am writing some web service code using CFX and JAXB. I check my code all the\nway to the point where I include it as an element of a larger document that\ngets passed into CFX framework for handling web service processing. When it\ncomes out, it has extra tags in it. It is sent to publish and subscribe server.\nWhen I try to read the data when I retrieve it from the server, CXF produces a\nSAX parse exception due to one of the extraneous namespaces which it wasn't\nexpecting. Now, it may be possible for me to intercept the data and remove the\nextranuous namespace definitions, but this is an enterprise system, and I\ncannot expect every other application to do this. Up until this point, my\nexperience with JAXB has been good. I like the performance, however, this issue\nbasically renders JAXB useless to me on this project. I would like to continue\nto use JAXB, however, I don't expect this to be fixed anytime soon, so I will\nneed to look into using some other data binding framework, perhaps XMLBeans\nwith CXF.\n\nPlease consider correcting this problem so I can continue using JAXB in\nconjunction with CXF."

For example take small secured services, these have lots of OASIS headers and small payloads. Unnecessary namespace overhead in these is big, while the overhead of traversing a dozen nodes would be negligible.\n\nI propose to have an optional feature (with a possibility to turn it on and off) to traverse the tree and eliminate unnecessary namespace declarations. This can be made even smarter; e.g. stop traversing after reaching 100th node."
