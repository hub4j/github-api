When an HTTP/2 stream times out it may impact\nthe stream only or the entire connection. With this fix OkHttp will now send HTTP/2 pings after\na stream timeout to determine whether the connection should remain eligible for pooling.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fix: Don't call <code>EventListener.responseHeadersStart()</code> or <code>responseBodyStart()</code> until bytes have\nbeen received. Previously these events were incorrectly sent too early, when OkHttp was ready to\nread the response headers or body, which mislead tracing tools. Note that the <code>responseFailed()</code>\nevent always used to follow one of these events; now it may be sent without them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>New: Upgrade to Kotlin 1.3.61.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>New: Match any number of subdomains with two asterisks in <code>CertificatePinner</code>. For example,\n<code>**.squareup.com</code> matches <code>us-west.www.squareup.com</code>, <code>www.squareup.com</code> and <code>squareup.com</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>New: Share threads more aggressively between OkHttp's HTTP/2 connections, connection pool,\nweb sockets, and cache. OkHttp has a new internal task runner abstraction for managed task\nscheduling. In your debugger you will see new thread names and more use of daemon threads.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fix: Don't drop callbacks on unexpected exceptions. When an interceptor throws an unchecked\nexception the callback is now notified that the call was canceled. The exception is still sent\nto the uncaught exception handler for reporting and recovery.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fix: Un-deprecate <code>MockResponse.setHeaders()</code> and other setters. These were deprecated in OkHttp\n4.0 but that broke method chaining for Java callers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fix: Don't crash on HTTP/2 HEAD requests when the <code>Content-Length</code> header is present but is not\nconsistent with the length of the response body.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fix: Don't crash when converting a <code>HttpUrl</code> instance with an unresolvable hostname to a URI.\nThe new behavior strips invalid characters like <code>&quot;</code> and <code>{</code> from the hostname before converting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fix: Undo a performance regression introduced in OkHttp 4.0 caused by differences in behavior\nbetween Kotlin's <code>assert()</code> and Java's <code>assert()</code>. (Kotlin always evaluates the argument; Java\nonly does when assertions are enabled.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fix: Honor <code>RequestBody.isOneShot()</code> in <code>HttpLoggingInterceptor</code>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Version 4.2.2</h2>\n<p><em>2019-10-06</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: When closing a canceled HTTP/2 stream, don't send the <code>END_STREAM</code> flag. This could cause\nthe server to incorrectly interpret the stream as having completed normally. This is most useful\nwhen a request body needs to cancel its own call.</li>\n</ul>\n</tr></table> ...

    "body": "I'm using a GitHub App with two goals: get the (private) repositories in an organization, and get the (private) members in the organization. \r\n\r\nThe way I'm using this API is by creating an installation of the app on my organization. My App is set to have read access to checks, members and metadata. Then I use the private key to generate a JWT token and authenticate with the API, which gives me a GHApp object. From there I'm using `listInstallations` to create a new GitHub object with the installation token. \r\n\r\nSo now I'm authenticated as my installation on the organization, which is where I expect to be. However from here I don't see any installation-specific methods I can use with this Java API. The `getRepositories` seems to use the `/user/{org}/repositories` endpoint, which means I only get the public repositories on my organization, whereas I'm looking for the [GET /installation/repositories](https://developer.github.com/v3/apps/installations/#list-repositories) endpoint. In addition to this, the `listMembers` method is also only showing me the public members, but not the ones marked as private in the organization. Am I missing something? I'm new to the GitHub API so I could just be not using this API correctly."
