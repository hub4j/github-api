    "body": "Jenkins has this concept of \"artifact fingerprinting\" where a build might say \"archive foo.war as an artifact\" and \"keep fingerprints of my build artifacts\". Here an example of some [build artifacts](https://ci.jenkins-ci.org/view/Jenkins%20core/job/jenkins_main_trunk/3208/).\n\nAnyways, in such a continuous deployment/delivery case where a build artifact (`foo.war`) might be passed from build to build in Jenkins, Jenkins will in fact track that file's progression through a pipeline. If one were to then deploy that file with Puppet, there would be no record of _where_ that file is deployed.\n\nThe `track` resource (which would need to be renamed) basically generates data for a Puppet report containing the md5 of the tracked file, such that it can be reported back to Jenkins so Jenkins can display which files went to what machines, and when, for a complete build and delivery pipeline.\n\n![amirite](http://funcorner.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/jack-nicholson-creepy-gif.gif)\n"

    "body": "I don't remember if plugin sync only copies plugins for modules you have declared in your manifest. I think it does all plugins, though.  \n\nIf that's the case, then the plugin code would get copied to every machine in your entire system, and likely compute an additional hash on every file resource.  What about recursive directories, and such?  I'd think that would slow down the system, and add to the volume of the reports.  I'm not entirely sure how many people would use this internal plugin, nor am I clear precisely how it works.. But if the effect is to slow down puppet runs on all servers, without a way to stop that behavior, just because you have our forge module installed... That doesn't sound like a good idea.\n"
