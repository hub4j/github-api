    "body": "Hey @krotte1, unlike Jesse and Devin I am not (yet!) an official committer to this project, so I defer to them for any official feedback. My comments below are merely suggestions, not blocking issues.\r\n\r\nThe feature seems useful, and I've wanted it in my own pipelines several times. I haven't reviewed the implementation yet, but I took a look at the proposed API change to the `retry` step and I have some ideas about that. Your proposed syntax is as follows:\r\n\r\n```groovy\r\nretry(count: 3, timeDelay: 10, unit: 'SECONDS', useTimeDelay: true) {\r\n  [...]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhenever I'm adding a new API, I try to study existing examples of similar APIs to learn from their mistakes and possibly gain insights that could benefit the design of my own API. In this case, I took a look at the API offered by [Tenacity](https://tenacity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#waiting-before-retrying), which is (to me) the gold standard in retry APIs. I use it frequently in my Python-based build scripts.\r\n\r\nTenacity offers several options when it comes to waiting before retries. I've used several of them myself, depending on the use case. Some examples:\r\n\r\n- Fixed period: `@retry(wait=wait_fixed(2))`\r\n- Randomness: `@retry(wait=wait_random(min=1, max=2))`\r\n- Exponential backoff: `@retry(wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=1, min=4, max=10))`\r\n- Fixed waits and jitter: `@retry(wait=wait_fixed(3) + wait_random(0, 2))`\r\n- Exponentially increasing jitter: `@retry(wait=wait_random_exponential(multiplier=1, max=60))`\r\n- Chain of backoffs: `@retry(wait=wait_chain(*[wait_fixed(3) for i in range(3)] + [wait_fixed(7) for i in range(2)] + [wait_fixed(9)]))`\r\n\r\nAs you can see, Tenacity is the \"Cadillac\" of retry APIs. Am I suggesting that you implement all of this in your PR? I am emphatically _not_ suggesting that.\r\n\r\nWhat I am suggesting, though, is that you [design for extension](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/config_design.html#DesignForExtension) so that these additional features could be added later.\r\n\r\nFor example, it might be worth sketching out some possible syntax for the fancier forms of time-based retry (such as backoff and jitter) and making sure that those future improvements could be made without having to break compatibility with the syntax being proposed in this change. That way, we can move forward with what you're proposing here with more confidence that future extensions won't run into implementation issues.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?"
