      "body": "**Background**: I became a maintainer of WinSW in 2014 or so, but the project is still hosted in @kohsuke's personal account. I do not have administrative access to the repo, and hence I cannot add more contributors, manage apps, etc. It was not a big deal before, because there were no contributors who would be willing to step up and help with maintenance. The traffic of incoming PRs also was not that high, so I was able to process them sooner or later. TBH rather the latter one, Jenkins core maintenance and other community roles soak the most of my time now. Nowadays I rather became an obstacle for @NextTurn .  \r\n\r\nInstead of just granting permissions, I suggest that WinSW gets moved to a Foundation so that we can resolve other bottlenecks for the project maintenance.\r\n\r\nOptions:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Foundation](https://dotnetfoundation.org/) - would be the most straightforward choice, especially since the foundation offers full .NET development/CI/CD ecosystem for the member projects\r\n  * Cons: Apart from using .NET to run, at the moment WinSW does not contribute to the .NET ecosystem. There is no special features offered for .NET applications\r\n  * It would be possible to convert WinSW to a framework by offering stable APIs and DLL packaging, e.g. to support self-installation of .NET apps. But the feasibility is arguable\r\n* [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) sub-project - Jenkins is a heavy user of WinSW for Windows installations, and we could move it there. Jenkins has well established governance and permission model, and it already hosts a number of components used elsewhere. Adding contributors and using non-Jenkins CI/CD systems is not a problem. In such case WinSW would be a part of [Continuous Delivery Foundation](https://cd.foundation/)\r\n  * Cons: Jenkins is probably a big user of WinSW, but it is still one of the huge number of users. Also, foundation goals mismatch\r\n* Do not worry about foundations, just create a new GitHub org for it as suggested in #79\r\n  * Cons: No support from Foundations, reliance on Freemium options offered by services. Same as now, basically\r\n\r\n",

It works when called on an instance of `GHIssue` directly but not on `GHPullRequest`.  I **think** this is because it calls `edit` rather than `editIssue` which is used by labels, assignees, etc and so it gets the wrong API endpoint for setting a milestone which is a property of the issue not the pull request.\r\n\r\nI would submit a fix for this myself, except: https://github.com/kohsuke/github-api/issues/415.

      "body": "@kohsuke \r\n\r\nI recently catched up on the CVE regarding proper account [validation](https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2018-09-25/#SECURITY-813). I guess this is why [pam_acct_mgmnt](https://github.com/kohsuke/libpam4j/blob/libpam4j-1.11/src/main/java/org/jvnet/libpam/PAM.java#L131) was added and even backported to 1.4.x. However, here's the problem: somehow **pam_setcred()** also got in.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Linux [man pages](https://www.systutorials.com/docs/linux/man/3-pam_setcred/) the user, aka the \"pam service\" needs proper permissions in order to actually apply credential changes -- if applicable. Thus, if the user who owns the jenkins process has no permission to actually execute pam_setcred() the login fails.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to: \r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/55841654/jenkins-invalid-username-and-password-pam-authentication\r\n\r\nand \r\n\r\nhttps://mapr.com/support/s/article/User-is-unable-to-login-on-the-MCS-page-after-upgrading-the-secure-cluster-to-6-0-version?language=en_US\r\n\r\nUsually, people then then to run jenkins as **root** which, IMHO, is not an option at all. Thus, I was wondering if the pam_setcred() method is a) really required or b) can be marked as optional in Jenkin's pam auth settings?\r\n\r\nLast, people seem to have forked this lib already just to comment this one line :(\r\n\r\nBest, \r\n  Florian\r\n",

Then in [`endBuild`](http://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/hudson/matrix/MatrixAggregator.html#endBuild%28%29), those files are parsed and aggregated.\n\nThe advantage of this approach is that it seems to aggregate the coverage in a nice way -- i.e.: if my MatrixBuild does a MatrixRun for Python versions 2.6, 2.7, and 3.3 and each of those has lines that are not covered but all of the lines are covered by at least one MatrixRun, then the coverage for the overall build will be reported as 100%.\n\nRefs:\n- https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-20706\n- https://github.com/jenkinsci/cobertura-plugin/pull/26 (this PR)\n- https://github.com/jenkinsci/cobertura-plugin/pull/22 (older PR)\n- https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jenkinsci-dev/yoamyzbqVro\n\nCc: @ssogabe, @kinow, @emanuelez, @kohsuke \n\ntest\n",

I am ready to proceed with this topic. \r\n\r\nJust to provide some context, I still need to re-setup the Windows development environment to do a release with MVS `14.0` tools version. I will likely be able to do it in few weeks when I get a new laptop (migrating from Mac to Windows). I hope to have a bit more time to maintain this component and the release environment, but it will be great to work together on this component.\r\n\r\n",

Every so frequently, let's say every week, a batch process can scan this index of all the support bundles in ES and extract a subset that is \"the best approximation of what's running out there today\". Something like \"for each unique install Id, find the latest support bundle that's submitted within the last 6 months\" --- so that every instance we know are represented once and only once by their latest support bundle, with some considerations for instances that are no longer there.\r\n>\r\n> The batch process can then push these bundles back into a separate index with additional \"asOf\" timestamp field.\r\n>\r\n> With this, the dashboard can use this \"asOf\" field as X-axis, and count of various fields as Y-axis. It will show the relative composition of different versions/OS/etc correctly, and controls for different frequencies in which customers submit bundles.\r\n>\r\n> I don't think this is too hard to pull off and the additional accuracy would be a great boon for engineering & PM.

This behaviour can be controlled through the boolean switch `org.kohsuke.args4j.ParserProperties#ignoreUndefinedOptions`. This is switched off by default. Currently it only works for fields annotated with `@Option` and not with `@Argument` fields. \r\nI added two unit tests.\r\nIf you would take this pull request into consideration, I'd be very grateful.
